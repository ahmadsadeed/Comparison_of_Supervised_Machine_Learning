# Comparison_of_Supervised_Machine_Learning

The goal of this paper is to compare six supervised machine learning algorithms on binary classification tasks. Four balanced and imbalanced datasets are used to
evaluate logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks, and na√Øve bayes algorithms using accuracy, average precision and receiver operating characteristic scores. Each classifier was tuned to wide ranges of values and hyperparameters during five trials and 5-fold cross validation using grid search. The results match experiments performed by Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil on a broader set of algorithms, problems, and performance metrics. Alternatives for null hypothesis statistical testing is proposed.
